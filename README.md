# TennisTune

Welcome to the GitHub repository for TennisTune! This application is designed for tennis players and enthusiasts who want to optimize their playing experience by tracking the string tension of their racquets.

## Features
- **Tension measurement** Measure the string tension of your tennis racquet.
- **Racquet management** Have multiple racquets? Create and manage racquets to track them all.
- **Racquet customization** You can customize the head size & string mass density for tension calculation.
- **Display units** Switch between lb and kg.

## How tension is measured
The tension is calculated based on the audio frequency by tapping on the string bed. We invite you to visit the project's wiki pages for detailed algorithms.

## Usage
1. Remove dampener from the string bed, if you use one.
2. Hold the tennis racquet at the throat. Do not touch the string bed.
3. Use a firm object (such as a spoon or a screwdriver) to repeatedly tap on the string bed.
4. The app will listen to the sound and display the tension.
5. Click the reset button to restart.
6. Customize your racquet specs (head size and string mass density) to get a more accurate result.

## Supported devices
